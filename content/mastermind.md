Guess what Andrew Carnegie, J.R.R Tolkien and Theodore Roosevelt all have in common? 

They were all part of a mastermind group 🧠. 

Mastermind groups have helped so many people gain a wealth of success - like Andrew Carnegie. He arrived in the US in 1848 with zip, nada, absolutely nothing. Half a century later, he was the richest man in the country after building the American steel industry. And guess what he claims he owes all his success to? That’s right - a mastermind group! One he built with Napoleon Hill, the creator of mastermind groups.

J.R.R. Tolkien was also part of one with C.S. Lewis. Without their mastermind group, would The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings even have made it from pen to paper? Would Lucy Pevensie ever have stepped through the wardrobe and met Mr Tumnus? Would Frodo ever have made it from The Shire to Mordor, thrown the ring into the volcano and saved Middle Earth from evil?!  

Who knows 😱?

Now, I’m not saying mastermind groups are only for those wanting to be the next Tolkien or Napoleon… maybe you just need some motivation or you’re lacking knowledge on a topic that would help your business grow? Whatever it is you’re struggling with, a mastermind group is there to help you in your journey and see you excel. But what exactly is a mastermind group and is it really that beneficial to be part of one? We’re taking a closer look 🔍. 
 
# What is a mastermind group?
A mastermind group is a select group of like-minded individuals who work together to help each other overcome challenges and achieve their goals. 
 
 
As part of a mastermind group, you’ll attend regular meetings and brainstorm ways to solve your problems. These meetings can be virtual or in-person (pre-COVID-19 😔). It’s a peer-to-peer mentoring model that can be highly successful as it helps individuals connect with others who’ll motivate them to meet their goals.
What are the benefits of a mastermind group?
According to American entrepreneur, motivational speaker and author, Jim Rohn, we’re the average of the people we spend the most time with. 
 
Whether we like it or not, we’re greatly influenced by the people closest to us, so it’s important to surround ourselves with supportive people who want to help us succeed. That’s exactly what a mastermind group provides, but here are some other benefits of joining one or creating your own:

## Share epic ideas… and some maybe not-so-good ideas
Hit a roadblock and not sure how to solve it? Maybe you have a new idea but you don’t know if it’s plausible? In a mastermind group, you’ll share new ideas with like-minded individuals who’ll give critical feedback and help you see things from different perspectives. 
 
By talking with other members and sharing what’s worked for each other and what hasn’t, you can apply this to your own business and avoid making the same mistakes others have made.
 
## Meet some awesome people
Mastermind groups are a great way to network and meet folks that are on a similar wavelength. Other members can connect you with their contacts who may be able to help you out and open doors that were otherwise closed. Having connections to people within various industries can come in handy when you least expect it.
 
 
Plus, you may find that other business owners in your mastermind group have products or services that complement your business, so you can build a partnership and work collectively to grow your business 📈.
 
 
## Be pushed to take accountability
A mastermind group is there to make sure you follow through with your plans. If you’ve said you’re going to do something, you’re more likely to do it if you have a group of people chasing you up and reminding you to. These groups hold you accountable and drive productivity - and if you’re struggling, they’re there to help with that too 🤗.
 
## Ride that quick learning curve
Mastermind groups have a great mix of people, all with a variety of different specialities and knowledge expertise. Maybe you’re a graphic designer that needs help with marketing? If there’s a member in your group who works in marketing, you can share your knowledge of graphic design while they share their knowledge of marketing with you. 
 
 
Mixing with people from different backgrounds, skills and knowledge creates the ideal environment to learn more, share your strengths and work on your weaknesses. By joining a mastermind group, you’ll gain invaluable knowledge faster than you would do on your own. 
 
## Different types of mastermind groups
There are lots of mastermind groups that are industry-specific, so you’ll find ones for life coaching, technology, marketing, playing the trombone, baking, movies... (literally anything you want). These kinds of mastermind groups are great for taking away specific knowledge in your industry. 
 
You can also join mastermind groups that are based on occupation - those are even more narrow, so you’ll learn even more relevant information specific to your occupation.
 
 
Mastermind groups have been around for so long because they actually work. Even Theodore Roosevelt started his very own mastermind group. At 42 years old, he was the youngest ever American President, which is why he needed a mastermind group to guide and support him while working with politicians a lot older than him. 
 
If some of the most well-known figures have started a mastermind group or have been a part of one, what’s stopping you 🤔?
 
# Why should you care about mastermind groups as a creator?
Mastermind groups are a viable way to make money in a low-touch way. Instead of preparing the work for clients and providing answers, you’ll be facilitating a group that will do the work themselves, saving you time. Mastermind groups are also more scalable compared to the one-to-one approach of normal coaching sessions, as you can charge each person for joining. 
 
Imagine what you could do if you were able to get expert advice and feedback on an ongoing basis. If you’re already part of a mastermind group, what do you like most about it? Do you have any tips about joining one? Or if you’ve created one and it’s going super well, go ahead and share your ideas with everyone. Let us know in the comments below!
